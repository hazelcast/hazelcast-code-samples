:description: In this tutorial, you'll connect to a Hazelcast cluster running in Kubernetes from outside of the Kubernetes environment.

== What You’ll Learn

{description}

== Before you Begin

* Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster
* Kubernetes command-line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl]
* Deployed xref:operator:ROOT:get-started.adoc[Hazelcast Platform Operator]
* Create a license secret:
+
Create a secret with your link:http://trialrequest.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast Enterprise License].

+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic hazelcast-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<hz-license-key>
----

NOTE: Starting with version 5.13, Hazelcast Platform Operator only supports Hazelcast Enterprise cluster creation. Even the feature can be used in Hazelcast Open Source clusters, Hazelcast Platform Operator requires license key to run a cluster.

WARNING: This tutorial uses LoadBalancer services to connect to Hazelcast from outside of the Kubernetes cluster. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that your Kubernetes cluster can assign public IPs to LoadBalancer services. This is particularly important if you are using a local Kubernetes cluster such as Minikube or Kind.

== Introduction

There are two available options for Expose Externally feature of Hazelcast Platform Operator:

- *Unisocket* - client requests are load balanced between Hazelcast members.

- *Smart* - client connects to all members and sends requests directly to the members owning the data.

Let’s see both approaches.

== Unisocket

The first option is to use the `Unisocket` type. This option will use the standard Kubernetes mechanism that automatically load balances the traffic to Hazelcast members.

=== Start the Hazelcast Cluster

Run the following command to create the Hazelcast cluster with Expose Externally feature enabled using Unisocket type.

[source, shell]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
include::ROOT:example$/operator-expose-externally/hazelcast-unisocket.yaml[]
EOF
----

For `discoveryServiceType` you can use:

* `LoadBalancer` - will create an external `LoadBalancer` for discovery service;
* `NodePort` - will expose the discovery service via `NodePort`.


=== Verify the Hazelcast Cluster

Check the cluster status by running the following command.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcast my-hazelcast-unisocket
NAME           STATUS    MEMBERS
my-hazelcast   Running   3/3
----

After verifying that the cluster is `Running` and all the members are ready (`3/3`), run the following command to find the discovery address.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcastendpoint my-hazelcast-unisocket
NAME                     TYPE        ADDRESS
my-hazelcast-unisocket   Discovery   34.135.7.75:5701
----

The `ADDRESS` column displays the external address of your Hazelcast cluster.

=== Connect Hazelcast Clients to the Cluster

To access all sample clients, clone the following repository:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/hazelcast-platform-operator-expose-externally.git
cd hazelcast-platform-operator-expose-externally/docs/modules/ROOT/examples/operator-expose-externally
----

. The sample code(excluding CLC) for this tutorial is in the link:https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/hazelcast-platform-operator-expose-externally/tree/master/docs/modules/ROOT/examples/operator-expose-externally[`docs/modules/ROOT/examples/operator-expose-externally`] directory.

Configure the Hazelcast client with the external address and disable smart routing to use the unisocket connection.

== Smart Client

The second option is to use the `Smart` type. With this option, each Hazelcast member will be exposed with its own service (it can be either `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`). Hazelcast smart client is capable of mapping the given key with its owner member, which means that it sends the data directly to the member which contains the right data partition.

.Hazelcast Smart Client
image::smart.jpg[Hazelcast Smart Client]

=== Start the Hazelcast Cluster

Run the following command to create the Hazelcast cluster with Expose Externally feature enabled using Smart type.

[source, shell]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
include::ROOT:example$/operator-expose-externally/hazelcast-smart.yaml[]
EOF
----

This will create the Hazelcast cluster and one `LoadBalancer` service for discovery and one `LoadBalancer` service for each pod.

For `discoveryServiceType` you can use:

* `LoadBalancer` - will create an external `LoadBalancer` for discovery service;
* `NodePort` - will expose the discovery service via `NodePort`.

For `memberAccess` you can use the following options:

* `LoadBalancer` - lets the client access Hazelcast member with the `LoadBalancer` service;
* `NodePortNodeName` - lets the client access Hazelcast member with the `NodePort` service and the node name;
* `NodePortExternalIP` - lets the client access Hazelcast member with the `NodePort` service and the node external IP/hostname.

=== Verify the Hazelcast Cluster

Check the cluster status by running the following command.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcast my-hazelcast-smart
NAME           STATUS    MEMBERS
my-hazelcast   Running   3/3
----

After verifying that the cluster is `Running` and all the members are ready (`3/3`), run the following command to find the discovery and member addresses.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcastendpoint --selector="app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-hazelcast-smart"
NAME               TYPE        ADDRESS
my-hazelcast       Discovery   35.184.21.18:5701
my-hazelcast-0     Member      34.121.197.134:5701
my-hazelcast-1     Member      35.238.20.134:5701
my-hazelcast-2     Member      34.30.60.128:5701
my-hazelcast-wan   WAN         35.184.21.18:5701
----

The `ADDRESS` column displays the external addresses of your Hazelcast cluster and members.

=== Connect Hazelcast Clients to the Cluster

Configure the Hazelcast client to connect to the cluster external address.
