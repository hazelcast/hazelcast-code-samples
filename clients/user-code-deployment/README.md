Client user code deployment code sample consist of two different mvn projects. This is to be able to demonstrate class deployment from client to server.  

⚠️ **NOTE:** This feature has been deprecated in favour of User Code Namespaces.

1. Run hazelcast member with user code deployment enabled. Note that, it does not contain the `IncrementingEntryProcessor` class that will be deployed from client.

```
cd user-code-deployment-member
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Member"
```

2. Run hazelcast client with user code deployment enabled. Client will first initialize the map with entries that have 0 as values. Then it will deploy and run `IncrementingEntryProcessor` on all entries. All values of map should be incremented to 1.

```
cd user-code-deployment-client
mvn compile exec:exec -Dexec.mainClass="Client"
```
