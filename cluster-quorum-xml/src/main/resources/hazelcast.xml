    The term "quorum" simply refers to the count of members in the cluster required for an operation to succeed.
    It does NOT refer to an implementation of Paxos or Raft protocols as used in many NoSQL and distributed systems.
    The mechanism it provides in Hazelcast protects the user in case the number of nodes in a cluster drops below the specified one.
