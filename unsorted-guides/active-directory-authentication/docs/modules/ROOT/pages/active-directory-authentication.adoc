:description: In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise to authenticate cluster members and clients using Kerberos tickets in the Microsoft Active Directory domain.

== What You’ll Learn

{description}

You will also cover the role mapping based on the user's group membership in the
Active Directory.

== Before you Begin

- Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise and its License Key (You can ask for a trial license through the https://hazelcast.com/get-started/#deploymenttype-imdg[license form]).
- Active Directory server (AD) and the 2nd Windows server connected in the Active Directory domain
- JDK 1.8+ (You can get Windows installer on https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-11-lts&os=windows&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk[Azul Zulu download page] for instance.)
- A text editor or IDE

=== Active Directory domain in MS Azure

If you don't have an Active Directory domain configured in your environment, you can provision
one in MS Azure. There is an Azure deployment template on GitHub which
starts a domain for you on few clicks:

* https://github.com/maxskunkworks/TLG/tree/master/tlg-base-config_3-vm

== Environment

The sample environment used in this guide contains 2 Windows servers

- Domain controller with Active Directory (hostname: `dc1`)
- Application server attached to the domain (hostname: `app1`)

The servers are connected to a domain named `acme.com`. Its upper-case version
is also the Kerberos realm name (`ACME.COM`).

Hazelcast connections are based on IP addresses, so they will be also necessary
for the Kerberos authentication configuration.

Following addresses are used in our environment:

[source]
----
10.0.0.10 dc1
10.0.0.11 app1
----

If you don't use the Azure test environment, then replace the hostname and IP values
to fit your environment in commands and Hazelcast configuration files used in this guide.

=== Hazelcast port on Windows Firewall

If you have Windows Firewall enabled, then allow access to the default Hazelcast
port numbers (`5701-5703`). You can use the following PowerShell command:

[source,powershell]
----
include::example$active-directory-authentication/allow-hazelcast-port.ps1[]
----

.Screenshot - Adding Windows Firewall Rule in PowerShell

=== Kerberos configuration file

Java searches the Kerberos realms configuration in the `krb5.ini` file on Windows.
The file contains the address of the Key Distribution Center (KDC) - i.e. Active
Directory server in our case.

So let's create one simple configuration file `C:\Windows\krb5.ini`
on both servers.

.C:\Windows\krb5.ini
[source,powershell]
----
include::example$active-directory-authentication/krb5.ini[]
----

NOTE: Kerberos protocol checks are often case-sensitive. Use the proper form
of principal names and use the upper-case Kerberos realm name!

== Create member accounts in Active Directory

We will use the PowerShell on the Domain controller to create an Active Directory
user account for each Hazelcast member.
We don't need to provide passwords, Active Directory will generate random ones for us.
We will also need a keytab file for each member.
Keytab files will contain the password as a shared secret used for authentication and Kerberos
ticket verification.

[source,powershell]
----
New-ADUser -Name hz-app1 -PasswordNotRequired $True `
  -PasswordNeverExpires $True -PassThru -Enabled $True
ktpass -princ hz/10.0.0.11@ACME.COM -mapuser hz-app1@ACME.COM `
  -out hz-app1.keytab +rndPass -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL

New-ADUser -Name hz-dc1 -PasswordNotRequired $True `
  -PasswordNeverExpires $True -PassThru -Enabled $True
ktpass -princ hz/10.0.0.10@ACME.COM -mapuser hz-dc1@ACME.COM `
  -out hz-dc1.keytab +rndPass -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL
----

Commands used:

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsadministration/new-aduser[New-ADUser]
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/ktpass[ktpass]

.Screenshot - New accounts in AD users GUI
image::ad-new-accounts-for-members.png[Users and groups in Active Directory.]

The `hz/10.0.0.10@ACME.COM` and `hz/10.0.0.11@ACME.COM` are Service Principal Names (SPN)
and we will reference them in the Hazelcast member configuration.
The `hz/` is a service prefix, followed by the IP address and the Kerberos realm name.

Move the newly generated keytab files to the `bin` directory within the Hazelcast
Enterprise installation (e.g. `C:\hazelcast-enterprise-4.1\bin`).

NOTE: As the `hz-app1` account will be used by the application server we need to
move the newly generated `hz-app1.keytab` file from the domain controller
to the application server.

== Configure Hazelcast members

We will use the YAML configuration file located in the `bin` directory.
We need to remove the existing member configuration file (`hazelcast.xml`) first.

[source,batch]
----
cd \hazelcast-enterprise-4.1\bin
del hazelcast.xml
----

Now we create the new configuration file called `hazelcast.yml`.
The file will define the network discovery method and security.

The simple form of Kerberos security configuration will be used - this should only be used for testing.

Following configuration is for the application server:

.C:\hazelcast-enterprise-4.1\demo\hazelcast.yml
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$active-directory-authentication/hazelcast-simple.yml[]
----

Use similar configuration on the domain controller. Just update principal name and
path to the keytab file:

[source,yaml]
----
principal: hz/10.0.0.10@ACME.COM
keytab-file: hz-dc1.keytab
----

Don't forget to replace
`PUT_THE_LICENSE_KEY_HERE` placeholder with a real license key.

Starting Hazelcast members on both servers should now result in forming
a new Hazelcast cluster with both members.

.Screenshot - Running Hazelcast cluster
image::two-members-cluster.png[Running Hazelcast cluster.]

Within the `security` configuration, we defined which realm is used for
the member-to-member authentication (`kerberosRealm`).

The security realm itself has two configuration parts:

- `authentication` - responsible for verifying incoming connections and mapping client roles;
- `identity` - defines a member's credentials - used to prove its own identity to other members.

The most important options in the `kerberos` authentication and `kerberos` identity configurations
are the `principal` (defines own Kerberos name) and `keytab-file` (file containing secrets of
given principal).

=== Simple Kerberos configuration warnings

A warning message is printed to the console when the simple Kerberos configuration form is
used for authentication. It gives us a hint on how to configure the full JAAS authentication.

.Connection initiator warning

        </properties>
      </login-module>
    </jaas>
  </authentication>
</realm>
----

We will show how to use the full Kerberos configuration form in next sections.

== Configure Hazelcast Client

Once we have the cluster running we will configure a client.
Its roles will be loaded from the Active Directory using the LDAP protocol.
We will use the existing domain user account for authenticating the client.

=== Create groups and mappings in Active Directory

To demonstrate the recursive role mapping feature, we will define two new
Active Directory groups. The first one, called "Acme Cache" will have its name
referenced in client permissions configuration on Hazelcast members.
The second group "Acme Cache Czechia" will be a member of the first one.
The active domain user (`hazelcast` in our environment)  will be added
as a member of the "Acme Cache Czechia" group.

[source,powershell]
----
include::example$active-directory-authentication/create-groups-and-map-user.ps1[]
----

=== Re-configure members

We used the simplified Kerberos configuration when we tried Kerberos
authentication between members. Let's use the full form now. We need it also
to enable Kerberos (GSS-API) authentication into Active Directory's LDAP
interface.

.C:\hazelcast-enterprise-4.1\demo\hazelcast.yml
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$active-directory-authentication/hazelcast.yml[]
----

What's new here are the explicitly defined `Krb5LoginModule` configurations
in security realms `krb5Initiator` and `krb5Acceptor`.

We also added the `ldap` sub-section in `kerberos` authentication. It's responsible
for searching recursively the group names which are used as client's roles.

The last change is defining the `client-permissions` section. We add one
universal permission which allows clients with role `Acme Cache` assigned all
operations on the cluster.

When we restart the members with this new configuration, they should again form
the cluster. The console is without warnings related to the simplified
Kerberos config now.

=== Check and Prepare Client Environment

We will run the Hazelcast Client Demo application on the application Windows Server.

Let's make sure the active user is authenticated to the domain using Kerberos
first. Let's use the `klist` tool in Windows (`C:\Windows\System32\klist.exe`).

[source]
----
C:\Users\hazelcast>C:\Windows\System32\klist.exe

Current LogonId is 0:0x1fda985

Cached Tickets: (2)

#0>     Client: hazelcast @ ACME.COM
        Server: krbtgt/ACME.COM @ ACME.COM

        Cache Flags: 0x1 -> PRIMARY
        Kdc Called: DC1.acme.com

...
----

If the `krbtgt` ticket is not listed in your environment, then try to logout and newly login
with a Windows *domain* account.

To make sure Java can access this ticket (stored in the Windows LSA store), we need
to allow access of external applications to the store. Let's run the following command:

[source]
----
Reg Add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters /v AllowTGTSessionKey /t REG_DWORD /d 1
----

=== Configure Hazelcast client

Let's create the `hazelcast-client.yml` configuration file in the `demo` directory
within the Hazelcast installation.

.C:\hazelcast-enterprise-4.1\demo\hazelcast-client.yml
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$active-directory-authentication/hazelcast-client.yml[]
----

The Kerberos configuration on the client side is similar to the member configuration.
We just need to define the `kerberos` identity and reference its `Krb5LoginModule`
configuration.

We don't define a keytab file, but we want to use existing credentials,
so we set the `useTicketCache` option value to `true`.

=== Run the client demo application

The client configuration is ready, let's start the client application now:

[source]
----
cd \hazelcast-enterprise-4.1\demo
clientConsole.bat
----

The application should successfully connect to the cluster and data operations
should work.

== Troubleshooting

Did anything go wrong in your setup? Try to look in more detail what's
happening underhood. Hazelcast and Java itself provide system properties which allow
printing Kerberos related debug messages to console.

You can also reconfigure the log level for the `com.hazelcast.security` category to inspect
authentication flow within the Hazelcast login modules.

Just edit the Hazelcast batch files (`start.bat`, `clientConsole.bat`) and
add the following arguments to the `java` program call:

[source]
----
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=debug-logging.properties \
-Dsun.security.krb5.debug=true \
-Dsun.security.jgss.debug=true
----

Create the new `debug-logging.properties` file beside the batch file:

[source,properties]
----
include::example$active-directory-authentication/debug-logging.properties[]
----

You can also add the `debug` option to `Krb5LoginModule` configuration. E.g.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: krb5Initiator
    authentication:
      jaas:
        - class-name: com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule
          usage: REQUIRED
          properties:
            debug: true
----

== Summary

We have configured the Hazelcast Enterprise cluster with Kerberos-based authentication
on the Active Directory domain.

First, we used the simple Kerberos configuration just for member authentication.
Then we added the full configuration and also included the client configuration.
The client authorization was based on group membership defined in the Active Directory.
