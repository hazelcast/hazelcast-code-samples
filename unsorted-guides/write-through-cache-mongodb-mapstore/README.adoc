This is an example of how to use MapStore and MongoDB with Hazelcast Cloud.

TIP: For step-by-step instructions of how to run this app, see the link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/tutorials/write-through-cache-serverless-mapstore[tutorial].

- `clusterId`: Id of your Hazelcast cluster
- `apiKey`: API key
- `apiSecret`: API secret

. Deploy the modules.
+
```bash
mvn clean package hazelcast-cloud:deploy
```

. Configure the following properties for the MapStore in the Hazelcast Cloud console:

- `uri`: link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/[MongoDB connection string]
- `database`: Name of your MongoDB database

== Internal Hazelcast Developers

If you want to try this application in the UAT or DEV environment, configure the `apiBaseUrl` element with your environment's URL. For DEV, use \https://test.dev.hazelcast.cloud, for UAT, use \https://uat.hazelcast.cloud.

```xml
<plugin>
  ...
  <configuration>
    <apiBaseUrl></apiBaseURL>
    ...
  </configuration>
