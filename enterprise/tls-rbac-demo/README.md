# Hazelcast Dynamic RBAC demo for TLS authentication

This code sample demonstrates a dynamic reconfiguration of role-based access control in Hazelcast.

The project contains three runnable classes:
* `Server`: runs a Hazelcast server instance embedded inside a simple Java wrapper application;
* `TimestampClient`: runs a Hazelcast client that puts and gets timestamps into an `IMap`;
* `ReplacePermissions`: dynamically changes the RBAC configuration by starting a new lite-member with a new permissions configuration. It gets a new permission configuration XML file path as the argument.

The lite-member has the `on-join-operation` attribute configured to value `SEND` to distribute the new set of permissions.

```java
  config.getSecurityConfig().setOnJoinPermissionOperation(SEND);
```

[Look into the documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.0/security/native-client-security#handling-permissions-when-a-new-member-joins) for more details about handling permissions when a new member joins.

The demo uses native TLS (BoringSSL).

## Requirements

* OpenSSL installed on the system;
* Hazelcast Enterprise license stored in the `~/.hazelcast-code-samples-license` file within your home directory.

## How to run the project

1. Run the `./00-create-keymaterial.sh` script to generate the `keymaterial` folder with certificates and keys;
1. Create a Hazelcast cluster by running one or more instances of `./01-server.sh`;
1. Start a client by running `./02-client.sh` script;
1. *(optional)* You may run another client with full permissions by starting `./02-client.sh resources/admin-hazelcast-client.xml`;
1. Change (grant) client permissions in the cluster by running `./03-grant-permissions.sh` and watch how the client log messages change;
1. Change (revoke) client permissions in the cluster by running `./04-revoke-permissions.sh` and watch how the client log messages change;
