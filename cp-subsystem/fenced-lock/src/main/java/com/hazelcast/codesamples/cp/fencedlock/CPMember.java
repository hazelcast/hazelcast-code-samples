/**
 * Configures a CP subsystem of 3 CP members. When you run 3 instances of this
 * class, it will form the CP subsystem. Then, it fetches
 * a CP {@link FencedLock} proxy. Each CP member acquires the lock 2 times and
 * releases it afterwards. Between acquires and releases, it prints the fencing
 * tokens assigned to itself.
 *
 * You have to set your Hazelcast Enterprise license key to make this code sample work.
 * Please have a look at {@link com.hazelcast.examples.helper.LicenseUtils} for details.
