This folder contains examples for Hazelcast Jet Kafka Connect sources.

There are 3 examples:
- `KafkaConnectMysqlSample`
- `KafkaConnectNeo4jSample`
- `KafkaConnectRedisSample`

Every example shows how users can use Kafka Connect sources to connect
to external systems like MySQL, Neo4j, Redis, without the need to write
custom connectors.

Requirements to build and run examples:
- JDK 17 or higher installed
- Docker installed
- Internet access (to download connector ZIPs)
