        => As payments flow in from Kafka, you'll see a stream of updates from the
        ReceiptsWatcher ("Watcher"). Each line will show you three metrics on these
        payments: QUD (number queued); WKG (number being processed); and FIN (number
        finished). After the metrics, you'll see a field for each of the various
        merchants (using the two-letter short name for the merchant; see table). At
        the right end of that field, you'll see something like
        "𝟙×${underline("5")}", which means node 𝟙 is processing that merchant's
        payments, and it has done 5 so far. The most recent count is always
        underlined. A failure simulator runs in the background to brings nodes down
        and up. As it does this, and Jet reschedules jobs to available nodes, you'll
        see this reflected in each merchant field; the existing data is shifted
        towards the left, as the newly scheduled node appears on the right.
