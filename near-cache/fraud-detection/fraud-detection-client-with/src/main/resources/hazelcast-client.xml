      == the network section, and a Near Cache configuration added  ==

    <!-- A Near Cache for the airports map
      == ========================================================== ==
      == A Near Cache has a number of configuration parameters that ==
      == allow you to tune the performance. Check the documentation ==
      == for the full list and their functionality.                 ==
      ==  Here we go with constraining the Near Cache to ten entries==
      == so we don't have to worry about running out of memory on   ==
      == the client (as typically the servers have more entries     ==
      == than a single client can accommodate). We discard the      ==
      == least frequently used, rather than the least recently used,==
      == to maintain the most beneficial entries on the client.     ==
      ==  When using a Near Cache, typically there is a balance to  ==
      == be found. For example 10% of records may contribute to 99% ==
      == of data access. If the Near Cache holds 9% it's not big    ==
      == enough to be optimal, and if it holds 11% it's oversized   ==
      == and this could affect garbage collection for little extra  ==
      == benefit.                                                   ==
